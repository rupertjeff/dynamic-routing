# Contributing

Either create issues or fork the project and send in a pull request with your fix. I will endeavor to respond to you in a timely manner. Please understand that I will make the final call on issues and pull request implementations. If you send in a pull request and I change up the code such that your pull request is not merged in but still use the idea, I will make a note of your pull request within the code. (If I forget, nudge me. Iâ€™m human, just like you!)
